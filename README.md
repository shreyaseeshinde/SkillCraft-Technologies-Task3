Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis
This project involves analyzing a bank marketing campaign dataset. The primary focus is on cleaning the data, encoding categorical variables, and building a decision tree model to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are: Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by splitting columns, renaming them, and converting data types. Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into numerical form for analysis. Model Training: Train a decision tree classifier to predict the target variable. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using accuracy and a classification report.

Dataset
Dataset Used: Bank marketing campaign dataset. Description: The dataset contains information about various attributes of clients, such as age, job, marital status, education, and the outcome of whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

Data Cleaning
Steps Taken: Column Splitting: Combined columns were split into separate columns. Renaming Columns: Columns were renamed to meaningful names. Data Conversion: Relevant columns were converted to numeric types for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Encoding Categorical Variables Objective: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using LabelEncoder.

Model Training
Decision Tree Classifier Model: A decision tree classifier was trained on the cleaned and preprocessed data. Features: The dataset's features included age, job, marital status, education, balance, etc. Target: The target variable was whether the client subscribed to a term deposit.

Model Evaluation
Accuracy: The model's accuracy on the test set was calculated. Classification Report: A classification report was generated to assess precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools & Libraries
Python: Used for data processing and model training. Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning. NumPy: For numerical operations. Scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
